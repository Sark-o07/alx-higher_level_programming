# 0x06-python-classes

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts related to classes and object-oriented programming in Python.

## Tasks

### Task 0: My First Square

File: `0-square.py`

An empty class `Square` that defines a square. No imports are allowed.

### Task 1: Square with Size

File: `1-square.py`

A class `Square` that defines a square by having a private instance attribute `size`. Instantiation includes a size argument. No imports are allowed.

### Task 2: Size Validation

File: `2-square.py`

A class `Square` that defines a square with size validation. It includes an optional size argument in the constructor. If the size is not an integer or is less than 0, appropriate exceptions are raised. No imports are allowed.

### Task 3: Area of a Square

File: `3-square.py`

A class `Square` with size validation and a public method `area` that calculates and returns the area of the square. No imports are allowed.

### Task 4: Access and Update Private Attribute

File: `4-square.py`

A class `Square` with size validation and private attributes. It includes properties to access and update the size attribute, and a public method `area` to calculate the area. No imports are allowed.

### Task 5: Printing a Square

File: `5-square.py`

A class `Square` with size validation and methods to calculate the area and print the square using the character `#`. If the size is 0, an empty line is printed. No imports are allowed.

### Task 6: Coordinates of a Square

File: `6-square.py`

A class `Square` with size and position validation. It includes properties to access and update the size and position attributes, as well as methods to calculate the area and print the square with the character `#`. The position determines the spacing of the square. No imports are allowed.

This README provides an overview of the tasks and the corresponding files in the repository. Each task focuses on different aspects of class definition, encapsulation, validation, and methods in Python's object-oriented programming paradigm.
