# 0x0A-python-inheritance

This repository contains Python scripts and classes that demonstrate various concepts related to inheritance in Python. Below is an overview of the contents of this repository:

| #   | Topic                  | Description                                                             |
| --- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | Lookup                 | Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object. |
| 1   | My list                | Write a class `MyList` that inherits from list and provides a `print_sorted` method to print the list in ascending sorted order. |
| 2   | Exact same object      | Write a function that returns `True` if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class; otherwise, it returns `False`. |
| 3   | Same class or inherit from | Write a function that returns `True` if the object is an instance of the specified class or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from the specified class; otherwise, it returns `False`. |
| 4   | Only sub class of      | Write a function that returns `True` if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class; otherwise, it returns `False`. |
| 5   | Geometry module        | Write an empty class `BaseGeometry`. |
| 6   | Improve Geometry       | Write a class `BaseGeometry` that includes a `area` method which raises an Exception with the message "area() is not implemented." |
| 7   | Integer validator      | Write a class `BaseGeometry` that includes an `area` method and an `integer_validator` method to validate integer values. |
| 8   | Rectangle              | Write a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry` and provides instantiation with width and height. |
| 9   | Full rectangle         | Write a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry` and provides instantiation with width and height, an `area` method, and a formatted representation. |
| 10  | Square #1              | Write a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` and provides instantiation with size and an `area` method. |
| 11  | Square #2              | Write a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` and provides instantiation with size, an `area` method, and a formatted representation. |
