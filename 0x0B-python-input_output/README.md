# 0x0B-python-input_output

This repository contains Python scripts and functions that demonstrate various input and output operations in Python, particularly focused on working with files and JSON serialization. Below is an overview of the contents of this repository:

| #   | Tasks                  | Description                                                             |
| --- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | Read file              | Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout. |
| 1   | Write to a file        | Write a function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written. |
| 2   | Append to a file       | Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added. |
| 3   | To JSON string         | Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string). |
| 4   | From JSON string to Object | Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string. |
| 5   | Save Object to a file  | Write a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation. |
| 6   | Create object from a JSON file | Write a function that creates an Object from a "JSON file". |
| 7   | Load, add, save        | Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list and then saves them to a file in JSON format. |
| 8   | Class to JSON          | Write a function that returns the dictionary description with a simple data structure for JSON serialization of an object. |
| 9   | Student to JSON        | Write a class `Student` with attributes and a method to retrieve a dictionary representation of a Student instance. |
| 10  | Student to JSON with filter | Extend the Student class to include a method that retrieves a dictionary representation with optional attribute filtering. |
| 11  | Student to disk and reload | Further extend the Student class to include a method for reloading attributes from a JSON representation. |
| 12  | Pascal's Triangle      | Create a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that returns Pascal's triangle as a list of lists of integers. |
