## Introduction

In this directory, you will find a collection of Python scripts and examples to help you get started with Python programming. We begin with the classic "Hello, World!" program to demonstrate the basic syntax and structure of a Python script. As you progress through the directory, you'll explore various Python concepts, such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples and scripts in this directory, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-higher_level_programming.git
```

Navigate to the `0x00-python-hello_world` directory:

```bash
cd alx-higher_level_programming/0x00-python-hello_world
```

## Contents

The directory contains the following files:

- `0-run`: A Bash script that runs the Python script `main.py`.
- `1-run_inline`: A Shell script that runs Python code.
- Other Python scripts: Additional scripts demonstrating various Python concepts, such as variables, loops, functions, etc.

## How to Use

To run the "Hello, World!" Python script, use the provided Bash script `0-run`:

```bash
./0-run
```

You can also run other Python scripts in the directory using the Python 3 interpreter:

```bash
python3 your_script.py
```

Feel free to modify and experiment with the scripts to deepen your understanding of Python programming.

## Contributing

We encourage contributions from the community! If you have ideas for improving existing scripts or want to add new examples, please feel free to submit a pull request. Before contributing, be sure to read our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
