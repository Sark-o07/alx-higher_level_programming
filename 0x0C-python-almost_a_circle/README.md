Certainly, here's the README for the `0x0C-python-almost_a_circle` repository in tabular form, starting from 0:

| **Section** | **Mandatory** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0. If it's not tested it doesn't work | Mandatory | All files, classes, and methods must be unit tested and PEP 8 validated. |
| 1. Base class | Mandatory | Create the `Base` class as the foundation for other classes. Initialize instance attributes and manage `id` values. |
| 2. First Rectangle | Mandatory | Create the `Rectangle` class, inheriting from `Base`, with private attributes and getters/setters. |
| 3. Validate attributes | Mandatory | Add attribute validation for `Rectangle` class, raising appropriate exceptions for invalid input. |
| 4. Area first | Mandatory | Implement the `area` method in the `Rectangle` class to calculate the area. |
| 5. Display #0 | Mandatory | Create a `display` method in the `Rectangle` class to print the instance using `#`. |
| 6. __str__ | Mandatory | Override the `__str__` method in the `Rectangle` class to provide a custom string representation. |
| 7. Display #1 | Mandatory | Improve the `display` method in the `Rectangle` class to consider `x` and `y` coordinates. |
| 8. Update #0 | Mandatory | Implement the `update` method in the `Rectangle` class to update attributes using arguments. |
| 9. Update #1 | Mandatory | Modify the `update` method in the `Rectangle` class to support keyword arguments. |
| 10. And now, the Square! | Mandatory | Create the `Square` class, inheriting from `Rectangle`, with size as both width and height. |
| 11. Square size | Mandatory | Add getter and setter methods for the `size` attribute in the `Square` class. |
| 12. Square update | Mandatory | Implement the `update` method in the `Square` class to update attributes using arguments. |
| 13. Rectangle instance to dictionary representation | Mandatory | Create the `to_dictionary` method in the `Rectangle` class to return a dictionary representation. |
| 14. Square instance to dictionary representation | Mandatory | Add the `to_dictionary` method in the `Square` class to return a dictionary representation. |
| 15. Dictionary to JSON string | Mandatory | Add the `to_json_string` method in the `Base` class to convert dictionaries to JSON strings. |
| 16. JSON string to file | Mandatory | Implement the `save_to_file` method in the `Base` class to write JSON strings to files. |
| 17. JSON string to dictionary | Mandatory | Add the `from_json_string` method in the `Base` class to convert JSON strings to dictionaries. |
| 18. Dictionary to Instance | Mandatory | Create the `create` method in the `Base` class to return instances with attributes set from dictionaries. |
| 19. File to instances | Mandatory | Implement the `load_from_file` method in the `Base` class to return a list of instances from JSON files. |
